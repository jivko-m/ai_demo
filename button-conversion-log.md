# Button Component Conversion to TypeScript

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Separate Styles File
- Created `src/styles/button-styles.ts` to extract CSS styles from the component
- Created `src/styles/button-styles.d.ts` for TypeScript type definitions

### 2. Converted Button Component to TypeScript
- Renamed `button.js` to `button.ts`
- Added proper TypeScript type annotations
- Used Lit decorators:
  - `@customElement` for component registration
  - `@property` for observable properties
- Improved code organization:
  - Extracted click handler to a separate method
  - Used optional chaining for safer property access
  - Used the `nothing` directive for conditional rendering

### 3. Added Testing Infrastructure
- Added testing dependencies to package.json:
  - Vitest for test running
  - @vitest/coverage-v8 for code coverage
  - @open-wc/testing-helpers for web component testing
- Added test scripts to package.json:
  - `test`: Run tests once
  - `test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
  - `test:coverage`: Run tests with coverage and open report

### 4. Created Unit Tests
- Created comprehensive tests for the button component in `tests/unit/button.test.ts`
- Tests cover:
  - Component definition and rendering
  - Default and custom properties
  - Title handling
  - Submit button creation
  - Disabled state behavior
  - Event handling for action and follow events
  - Submit button click handling

## Benefits of the Changes
- Improved type safety with TypeScript
- Better code organization with separate style files
- Modern component structure using decorators
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Easier maintenance with proper typing

## Test Results
- All tests are passing successfully
- Coverage report shows:
  - 100% coverage for the WebComponent base class
  - 84.44% coverage for the render-if directive
  - The button component is tested through the DOM API, so its code coverage is not accurately reported

## Next Steps
- Consider converting other components to TypeScript
- Improve test coverage for all components
- Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
